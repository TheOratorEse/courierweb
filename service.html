                        In the IT industry, today's logistics needs of various industries are typically changing and escalating, regardless of their economy. In the IT industry, the difference between success and failure is closely related to supply/value chain integration, where there are two different process measurements:                    </p>

                            The delivery of goods and services to customers in the most reliable delivery period (preferably the shortest) becomes possible. "Reliable" implies a certain guaranteed shipping time for the package to reach the customer or the company needs to respond to any abnormal events.

                            The recognition of the reverse flow of signing records, without these, in many cases, the recovery of bills is impossible. Especially in such a company will place more orders, which can cover hundreds of cities.
                            The task for the supplier is amazing-
                             Plan logistics delivery to all these locations and hope that the previous bill can be submitted to the customer to refund 100% of the delivery record. In most IT companies, the role of "logistics" or "completion" is the key.
